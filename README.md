**Overview:**
This project was build for my bachelors thesis in computer science. It was build using Angular and SpringBoot, so java, typescript, HTML and CSS were incorporated as well.
I tried to build this app with my own unique design choices and style, and tried to avoid plug-and-play bootstrap components and methods. Its build with responsitivy and 
clarity in mind, to suit every device screen witdh, as well as the user themselves.

This code was meant to create an e-commerce shopping site for a local bread bakery, so it provides neccesarry functionalities like browsing products, managing cart items,
and contacting the shop directly through built in message system. Looking at the site from the perspective of a pep.net employee, they have also access tp an admin page,
where you can modify aviable products. There is an additional page for viewing and managing user messages and orders. 

This project thaught me a lot about delivering a fullstack application, using popular web frameworks, and an overall design of responsive websites.
